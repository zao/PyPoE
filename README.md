With development on [OmegaK2/PyPoE](https://github.com/OmegaK2/PyPoE) being discontinued, this repository was forked from [RePoE](https://github.com/brather1ng/RePoE) and exists solely to keep the [Community Wiki](https://poewiki.net) updated.


PyPoE
========

Collection of Python Tools for [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/).

More detailed docs: [http://omegak2.net/poe/PyPoE/](http://omegak2.net/poe/PyPoE/)

The docs will be updated soon with details on how to update the specification for new leagues.


Common Problems & Advisory
--------
* Install **Python 3.7** for maximum compatibility:
* **UI will be reworked for bundle support and is not functional at the moment**
* On Windows 10 machines there seems to a be bug in the Python installation that prevents arguments being passed to the command line interface; you can identify this issue if you get a "help" listing if you supplied more then 1 argument. See [this on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2640971/windows-is-not-passing-command-line-arguments-to-python-programs-executed-from-t) for possible solutions


Overview
--------
Parts:
* Library toolkit for programmers (PyPoE/poe)
* UI based on Qt for browsing the game files (currently not working)
* CLI interface for extracting/exporting data (for the wiki, more TBD)

Important Notes
--------
Alpha Stage:
* Code structure and in particular the API may change at any time
* Incomplete in many areas (check files and TODOs)
* Tests still have to be written for a lot of things.
* Many functions and classes are not yet fully documented

Dev branch:
* Broken code may be committed occasionally to the dev branch
